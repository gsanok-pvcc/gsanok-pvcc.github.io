    <h1> The 13th Amendment: One Step Towards Freedom </h1>
    <p> The 13th Amendment is one of the most important and impactful chnages to the constitution that has ever been made by the government.
        The main purpose of the 13th Amendment was to end the terrible act which was slavery in the United States, and to forever end the forced servitude of any man or woman.
        However, the amendment itself impacted the entire country in ways that poeple may not know about without understanding the time period in which the amendment was passed.
        The idea of abolition had been one that had torn the nation apart. The Civil War was fought with the issue of slavery at the center of it.
        Although the amendment was not fully ratified by the nation until December 6, 1865, the document itself was passed by congress on January 31, 1865. 
        The constitutional change reads as follows: "Neither slaver nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."
        The wording used within the amendment would prove costly, and some may argue that it was worded in that manner intentionally. The phrase, which reads: “Except as punishment for crime” has in turn led to the largest case of mass incarceration in human history, spanning over one hundred and fifty years. 
        This wording led to the then free African-American people being systematicallt arrested and sent to prison, often for crimes they did not commit, or for the smallest petty crimes. 
        In these prisons, they could then be used for free labor and had essentially found themselves stuck in a form of slavery again, after having spent so many years hoping and fighting for freedom.
        This effectively reinstituted slavery underneath the guise of unpaid prison labor. And while this all occurred one hundred and fifty years ago, the lasting affects of these events are still seen in America today.
        We as a nation are still facing the issue of mass incarceration within society, and the ratio of people of color being arrested compared to caucasian people is still a staggering number.
        When looking at averages, the United States has a incarceration rate which is five times higher than the averages for the rest of the world.
        For every one hundred people sent to prison everywhere else, we imprison five hundred.
        And the amount of these prisoners who are people of color in comparison to white people tells the story of there still being an underlying sense of institutional rasicm and unfair stereotypes within our naiton.
        According to the United States Census data from January of 2021, the population percentage of white people in America made up 75.8% of all citizens, with African-Americans only representing 13.6%.
        When comparing the entire population data to data taken from the Bureu of Justice Statistics, a clear pattern can be seen.
        In state prisons, African-Americans are incarcerated at a rate 5.1 times higher than white people. For every one white person sent to prison, there are five black people sent.
        This ratio when compared to the populaiton statistics is almost nonsensical, and cleary shows that there is a flaw in the way our prison system works.
        Perhaps if the thirteenth amendment was phrased differently, this issue would not still be one that plagues us as a country.
        While there is still much to do in regards to equal rights and freedoms for all, the thirteenth amendment did in fact accomplish the goal it set out to do.
        Slavery, the largest stain on the history of our nation, was ended, and many people who had only ever hoped of living a life outside of chains saw that dream achieved in their lifetimes.
