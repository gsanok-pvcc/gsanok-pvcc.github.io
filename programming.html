                            <li>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended</li>
                            <li>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</li>
                            <li>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.</li>
                            <li>Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.</li>
                            <li>Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.</li>
                            <li>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.</li>
                            <li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</li>
                            <li>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</li>
